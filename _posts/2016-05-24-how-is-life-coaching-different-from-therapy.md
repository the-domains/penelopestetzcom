**Why choose me as your Life Coach?**

I offer a diverse business background, including talents in administration, sales, marketing, identity creation, computer expertise, and communication. I have been a teacher, a professional speaker, best-selling author, and a top-ranking sales person.   
Over the years, I have worked for a variety of companies from Fortune 25, to a large "small business," to being self-employed with my own company.  
The diversity of my experiences enables me to relate to many different individuals on a variety of levels.   
My intuitive skills and sales experience allow me to discover the real issues affecting a person's performance. My positive attitude and possibility thinking help me to develop a program for your success.  
You will benefit from the fact that I have provided "coaching" to friends and acquaintances for more than thirty years, and therefore have experience, even though my Life Coach Certification is recent.   
I am an expansion and possibilities thinker and often called the "voice of reason." This allows me to show you options you might not have considered, yet keep you grounded in reality and attainability.  
As a **Certified Law of Attraction Advanced Practitioner**, I can show you how your thoughts become things, and help you ensure that you are thinking the thoughts necessary to live the life or your dreams!

### **How is life coaching different from therapy?**

The key differences are requirements from the state to function. A life coach does not usually need to be licensed by the state to perform services, whereas a therapist usually needs to be licensed by the state to practice. Another difference is in the level of training: therapists typically have a college degree; this isn't required for a life coach. A life coach has "clients" versus a therapist, who has "patients or clients."

### **The Value of Life Coaching for your Business**

Life coaching in business can range from career planning and development to motivation and time management to entrepreneurial and small business development. It can also involve consultative coaching at the corporate level. Learning to prioritize workflow, and stay motivated can be the crucial key to success. Planning a career can allow it to flourish rather than being a wandering generality.  
Candidates for life coaching in business can include executives, business owners, self-employed business owners, and managers looking to develop leadership skills.

### **The Value of Life Coaching for your Personal benefit**

Individuals often look for guidance and coaching in their personal lives in the areas of personal growth and change, to seek balance between work, family, and spiritual goals, or to enhance their relationships. Others seek guidance to creativity and out-of-the-box thinking, and turn to a mentor or coach.  
People want to get to know themselves better, develop the ability to set and attain goals, accomplish and achieve more in their lives. Coaching can knock the first brick or two out of the wall so that s/he can break through it.
